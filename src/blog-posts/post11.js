        This week was a good one for me. I enjoyed working with Python more and learning SQL. The SQL Heroes project was 
        very fun to me and I enjoyed getting to add some of my personal flair (maybe not 37 pieces of it) to the 
        project. It was nice this week to also work here and there as a group and spend time doing small 
        pseduocoding sessions together for specific aspects of the project.

        What are some similarities and differences you can see with JS and Python?
        Some similarities I see are that both are very powerful and can do a lot to create and connect in a program. 
        It was actually neat to use Python to write SQL specific statements that would then alter or command the 
        database. Furthermore, Python seems more restrictive but I do love that it forces you to have neat code or 
        it simply won't work. That is the one big difference I see between it and JS. JavaScript simply doesn't 
        seem to care about what you want to do, it will just look away and let you do it while Python seems to say, 
        "you can but only if you stay inside these lines". I loved connecting to the back end and finally seeing how 
        everything is connected this week.

        If you had started with Python instead of JS, how do you think the Bootcamp would be different? 
        Would you have benefited?
        I think that if I had started with Python then making cleaner JS would have been an easier task as that 
        muscle memory would have been ingrained...much like the muscle memory of adding semicolons and parentheses 
        was ingrained from JS and caused a lot of backspacing while writing in Python. I feel that the bootcamp 
        would not be much different but the order would obviously have changed and the comfort of using HTML and 
        CSS would potentially have been non-existent until much later. Whether or not I would have benefitted from 
        that reversal, I don't know. I feel that I wouldn't have as I think that the prior use of JS was needed to 
        really give me the ability to "see" in my mind what would be shown when using Python and SQL where as starting 
        with them before using JS would have caused that imagining of what would show in the front end to be MUCH more 
        difficult.
    
        Find one API, NPM package, Library, and/or Framework you think you might want to use for your final project.
        The PokeAPI...hands down that's the only one that I think I've found that seems like something I could enjoy using 
        for a project. Building a PokeDex that you can use to look up various Pokemon would be neat, especially if you can 
        save some as favorites in some way.
    
        In general, this week was a fun one and I look forward to learning Django and being able to do what I did this week 
        in an easier fashion.

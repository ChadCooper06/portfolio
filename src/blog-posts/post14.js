            Week 14 has seen us do so many incredible things (to us) and we're all the better for what we have learned and 
            how we have progressed. We are in the final stages of the bootcamp and I know we will all succeed. There's no 
            doubt that each of us is now able to do so much more than we could have 14 weeks ago. I am much more confident 
            in my abilities now than I was and those abilities will only continue to grow.

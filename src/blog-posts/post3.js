        SHEW! Week three has been ROUGH but it was also very enlightening. 
        I struggled a lot and still managed to end the week with a working set of code. 
        There were other things I would have loved to have been able to do to the alarm clock I made, 
        but I simply ran out of time with having to research so much due to my skill level being as 
        low as it is. Even with that lack of progression (in my opinion only), I feel that I did a fair 
        job and learned a lot. I failed often this week and managed to break my code over and over and 
        over and over. I have gained a modicum of confidence..but as Vikram said in that episode of 
        The Office:

            "Confidence. The food of the wise man, but the liqour of the fool."

        With that said, I cannot let my gained confidence make me think I can code like a professional 
        just yet. I have a ways to go.

        **What are my thoughts on the roles HTML, CSS and Javascript play in the process of rendering content 
        and providing a user experience?**
        In my opinion, and the scope there is limited due to how little knowledge I have regarding code 
        languages, HTML, CSS and JS are what create the actual page and interfaces that we see and use daily 
        on the internet. I know there are other languages doing work behind the curtain and many many more 
        that can do very cool things on the user side (maybe learn some of them during bootcamp). I like HTML 
        and CSS...JS has been a love/hate relationship thus far. I like what I can do with it, but I dislike 
        how difficult it is to make it do those things. As I gain experience with it I know I will like it 
        more, but honestly, this week of trying to fight with it has been very frustrating and there were 
        times I wanted to make it disappear like a mobster doing "waste disposal". Then, when it worked, I saw 
        that the plain, basic thing I had written with my HTML and CSS could function and do some cool stuff.
        I think a webpage made without all of these would be a very drab affair, if it could even be made at 
        all. The possibilities I see with the combination of HTML, CSS and JS make me excited because I am 
        eager to continue to learn more and try new things. The level of functionality and usability they can
        give when combined is just a very cool thing to know even exists, let alone being something I can 
        DO.

        **What are some objects that my blog incorporates?**
        Currently, as I am using a premade layout for my blog (that will change), 
        there aren't many objects that I can see using DevTools. I see a document object, which allows my JS 
        to connect to my HTML, and a navigator object which appears to show something about the browser...
        though my assumption there could be falso and I don't know what information it's trying to convey yet. 
        There also appears to be a metas object but I have no clue what it does. At some point I will make this 
        blog my own and fill it with objects, functions and variables. It will be like the British Museum, 
        except its contents would actually be mine. That's a future me thing, though he needs to get started 
        or I will start ribbing him for being a lazy nerd.

        During week 2 I have gotten better at using GitHub and GitPod and working with the CLI on GitPod. 
        We also started using HTML (HyperText Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets). I have worked 
        with these some on my own in the past and this has been both a refresher and an increase in both knowledge 
        and skills. 
        The COOLEST thing I have delved into this week has been the DevTools on Chrome and playing around with 
        those has literally left a smile on my face and I am excited to continue to learn more about them and become 
        more proficient in their use (as well as everything else I am learning e.g. CSS).

        **What is something you wish you could do but currently do not have the coding skills to accomplish?**
        The obvious answer here is that I wish I had the skills to make a really cool and interactive website or program. 
        I know I'm on my way there, very slowly, and that it will be awhile before I reach that level of competency. However, 
        I also know that I am further along at this point than I thought I would be and I am proud of the degree of skill my 
        fellow students and myself have already achieved.

        **What are you struggling with?**
        Currently I am not *struggling* with any specific skill, technic or aspect of the class. I am aware, however, 
        that I will end up struggling a lot during the bootcamp. I am ready for that though... I am not sure if I 
        am trying to convince myself with that statement or if it's true but I won't stop until the struggling is in the 
        past.

        **How do you solve a problem?**
        Thus far, when I have encountered any problems, I have ventured to find the answer on my own with the help 
        of my classmates, instructors and a couple friends who code for work as my backups. I have not yet encountered 
        an issue that I have been unable to surmount on my own during bootcamp, but when it does happen I will have a 
        safety net of people who will keep me from falling too far. Plus, the almighty Google has been a slight help too.

        **What methods do you use to help yourself get unstuck?**
        My initial tactic to unclog myself from an issue is to take a short break and walk away for a few minutes. 
        I usually spend 3-5 minutes playing with my cat or playing a short game on my phone just to disconnect my 
        brain from the issue so that when I return to it a couple minutes later I am looking at it with fresh eyes. 
        Then, if that doesn't fix it, I will try to get help from Google.

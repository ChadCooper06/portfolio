        Week 4 has been equally as confusing as the previous weeks but we did a cool thing and made a 
        bouncing ball app using JS. Nervous for the in person classes and what all else we have to learn 
        but still looking forward to the weeks ahead. Writing code is not an easy thing to do but I will 
        do it! With each new week I feel that we are all getting better and better and I can see that while 
        my growth is slow, it is also not stopping. That makes me very happy. This week saw no specific 
        questions asked of me for inclusion in the blog so that just means that we've been given a small 
        reprieve before in person class starts.

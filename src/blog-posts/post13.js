        ATTACK OF THE CLONES! Not the Star Wars version...but we are cloning websites and starting our final projects. 
        It's getting real and we are so close to the end. All of us have grown so much and I both want the bootcamp to 
        be over and want it to never stop. Not a lot to say this week. Everything is coming to fruition and it's scary 
        as well as being exciting.

        Halfway through the entire bootcamp and still loving every second. This week we were introduced to React 
        and used that JS library to create a website for a fake restaurant. The React library seems to help make 
        the process of creating a site much more developer friendly as it gives you more concise ways to write JS. 
        I have very much enjoyed this week and the project we completed. We also did a React project where we were 
        tasked with taking an already complete page that was riddled with bugs and finding and fixing them all. 
        This helped me understand how easy some bugs are to make and how they can completely break your code. It 
        also gave me a good chance to learn some other things in React that weren't part of the regular instructions 
        for the first half of the week. 

        Some questions relating to this week and my thoughts are:

        Do you think JavaScript Frameworks and Libraries are easy or hard to use? Why?
            * I think that JS frameworks and libraries are easier than vanilla JS because they allow the developer 
            to use smaller and more concise components of code to do the same thing as something more verbous. This 
            keeps your code cleaner and pervents as many mistakes as there is less overall characters generally. It 
            is also a more structured way of writing in JS, which is very much not structured, and that leads to less 
            confusion and an easier ability to read the code that is written.
            * The only difficult aspect of React was the learning curve for the ways it differs from vanilla JS and how 
            certain components of it need to be written in certain locations and orders so it can work...as well as the 
            need for parameters and functions to have names specific to them and as descriptive as possible.

        What Frameworks or Libraries are you interested in learning more about?
            * I want to learn more of React as I really like the way it is set up and I like the ways that it improves 
            the vanilla JS framework.
            * I have not researched many other libraries but if they are all similar in usage to React and keep JS from 
            being as open to possibilities as vanilla JS is then I imagine I will like them.

        Find one emerging JavaScript tool that you would like to learn more about or use in your final project.
            *At this point, learning more React would be really ideal, as well as just learning more JS. However, Vue.js 
            seems to be something I may enjoy as well. From the little I have read on it thus far it seems to use a lot of 
            the same syntax as React but with simpler techniques that become more flexible in some cases.

            Only one week left... we have all grown so much, and even though I am aware that my skills are still new and limited, 
            I am happy with my progression and how much I have learned. Only one week left and it has been one of the best times of 
            my life. So much learning was thrust into this time period and I would never have guessed that I would have been able to 
            do what I have done if it weren't for my coaches and cohort.

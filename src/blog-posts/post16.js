        Not gonna lie...writing this post is emotional and I'm not sure I can get through it all without crying.
        It has been a long 16 weeks, which felt like a fraction of that. I wouldn't trade a minute of it for anything.
        The cohort I have been a part of is an amazing group and each has endeared themselves to me. We are a band of
        brothers (and one sister). 
        Blair is one of the nicest and absolutely coolest people I have met and her projects have been amazing 
        each week. Corey, an honorable member of the Republic of Chads (inside bootcamp joke), has been a great 
        help and is one day going to absolutely kill it at making amazing games. I have full faith in him. Jordan 
        is a bloodhound of a person and I am sure that nothing on this planet will keep him from creating some amazing 
        code in the future. He also happens to be one of the most helpful people on this planet and I think all of us owe him 
        at least one of our wins. Kestner is easily  one of the people I've met in life with an obscene knowledge of video 
        games and movies. Talking to him is super fun and his final project was as good as most live sites I've ever been on. 
        Anthony, who I'm pretty certain is an 800 year old daywalking vampire, was the biggest supporter of our class and the man 
        has NO FEAR when it comes to interacting with others or asking questions. On top of that he's super cool to talk to and 
        ...CRAB STICKERS!! Chad P, gave himself a hard time every single week but the man absolutely killed it at making 
        quality code every single week and managed to be the best friend of everyone in the class from the start. Last, but 
        certainly not least, Nick is a super cool and interesting guy who has done some cool things and easily had some of my favorite 
        design work of anyone in the cohort. He also came in clutch multiple times by using his Googling skills for the benefit of all. 
        
        Our coaching staff was, in a word, awesome. Justin got us started off with a good foundation, and was always there to give constructive 
        criticism as well as all the dad jokes you could want. Jonathan was a huge help to everyone and managed to somehow 
        always find the issue in your code within seconds. The man just cannot be stumped and it's absolutely wonderful to have him 
        show you how to fix whatever was wrong without ever actually showing you. Reece honestly made waking up early every morning worth it. 
        He kept the jokes flowing, was always helpful and made us all feel at ease with our learning. Finally, Josh... Honestly, I don't think 
        we could have asked for a better leader/teacher/senior dev. He learned very quickly how each of us learned and was able to 
        use that knowledge to better help us all. I always loved his feedback and I know he had moments where we frustrated him, but he 
        never let that lessen his coaching and routinely went above and beyond to help us or figure out a way to teach us all a new skill.

        All in all, these 16 weeks were a wonderful time in my life. I made some great friends, learned a lot, and feel like I am now prepared to 
        head into the world of web development and continue my journey. I wouldn't trade these 16 weeks or any of the awesome people in them for anything.
        
        My experience was, in a word, awesome.

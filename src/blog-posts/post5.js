        FIRST week of in person classes and it has been a rollercoaster of emotions and code. 
        We learned a lot about atomic design, using Bootstrap and our introduction to "state" 
        and state management began. Thus far, I have almost zero clue about how state works but 
        hopefully soon I will begin to understand it. Our project was a mind reading game that used 
        a mathematical algorithm to "predict" a symbol you "chose".

        Week 9 is the second week of React and we worked on making a to-do list app...which caused us all to 
        hate the words 'to-do' because we used them too many times. This week was hard for me as I had some of 
        my depression and anxiety creep in and that caused me to kind of retreat into myself while doing the 
        project, which I think hampered my work a little. I still had a working app on Friday and I am still 
        proud of what I made because it was not something I could have done last week or even on Monday. I know 
        that one of my weaknesses in the bootcamp is that I don't ask questions as much as I probably should and 
        I am working on that. I have always been a bit of a loner and typically feel like I bother people if I ask 
        them anything...that's a me thing though and it is something that I think this bootcamp is helping to break 
        me out of.
        This week was also very fun for me and I have seen a lot of growth in my skill and my (still low but 
        growing) confidence level. I have a great group of fellow students and the instructors are some of the 
        coolest people. Also, I love React and have begun porting my blog over into a new repo that uses React.

        What have you learned about CLIs? Do you think they are scary?
            CLIs, command line interfaces, are not scary..but they can take some time to get used to using. I have 
            experience with DOS from when I was young and from two previous jobs so using my terminal isn't scary 
            but the needed terminology in newer CLIs has been sometimes difficult to remember.

        If you were to build a CLI, what would it do?
            If I were to build a CLI I suppose it would be similar to others. I know that in my background 
            investigator position the CLI we used would take in MS Word formatted information we typed and 
            convert it to another form that was easier for it to save and display in a searchable fashion(and 
            was the only US Government system to never be hacked) so If I were able to make one I would like 
            it to be something similar where it could be used to help keep sensitive information secret while 
            presenting an easy way to search and add to it.
            
        List some ideas that without a Framework, would take you a long time to code.
            I think that the to-do list would have taken a VERY long time for me to code without the React 
            framework and making any kind of server side system would be difficult without the use of Python, 
            which we are starting next week. Any of the more functional websites would be very bloated with 
            code if it weren't for frameworks making the formatting easier.

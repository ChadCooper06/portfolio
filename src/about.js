          Hey there! I'm Chad and I'm a full stack Jr developer currently located in the horse capital of the world. From January to May 2022 I attended and completed an 
          intensive 16 week web development bootcamp through Awesome Inc. This taught me how to learn code as well as multiple languages, 
          frameworks and libraries. The decision to attend the bootcamp was a hard one but was also one of my best decisions. I loved every moment 
          and I am more than ready to continue my journey as a developer and make my mark.<br/>
          <br/>
          I enjoy learning, sharing what I know, and breaking things down to see how they work. Writing code has been an amazing way for me to 
          do all of those at the same time and I'm only sad I didn't start sooner. Prior to attending the bootcamp I have had multiple positions 
          in hospitals, manufacturing and governmental work but none ever left me loving what I was doing. Writing code has changed that for me and 
          my previous positions have each contributed to prepare me for this eventual journey.<br/>
          <br/>
          Outside of coding, I enjoy; reading, cooking, hiking/camping, learning new things (I taught myself multiple edible and medicinal wild plants as 
          well as how to survive in the wilderness), working out, traveling and being a chew toy for my cat.
